# Coin Collect

Hello! In this game you are a frog, who's in training to be a ninja. Your kung-fu master is a well seasoned vetran, and afer a while of teaching is asking for a payment. Unfortunatly, you are broke. Your Master, Mr.Toad tells you about this secret world where there are plentifull gold coins, and if you want to continue your training you must navigate this dangerous maze.
In this game you can use arrow keys to move.
I made this project because I have allways loved to play the Mario platformer games, and wanted to create a similar experience.
I made this game in godot and used the Pixel Adventure Pack for the graphics.
